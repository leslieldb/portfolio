                        Right now, I have just completed my IT Programming program at Nova Scotia Community College, and I am now enrolled in 
                        a Bachelor of Computer Science at Dalhousie.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I have been looking for work terms, and just recently someone reached out to me regarding one. This will be my first 
                        IT work term ever if I get it, and I'm very eager to start my way into the industry.

                    <p class="right-desc">
                        My end educational goal is a Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science at Dalhousie, which I am well on my way towards. This has 
                        been a dream of mine for almost a decade now, and I'm very excited to finally get this under way. I have no doubts that I'll 
                        do very well.
                        <br/><br/>
                        As for my end career goals, I'm not certain about them yet. What I do know is that after I graduate from Dalhousie, I want to 
                        make my way up the software engineering and software development positions, with my current main goal being the 
                        senior developer position. I want to be able to gain many advancements throughout my programming career and build my 
                        professionalism even more.

                        If I want to achieve my career goals, the biggest thing I need to do is start networking. I have many friends in the industry 
                        who have told me that this is by far the most important thing when it comes to a career, especially in IT.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The first thing I will do regarding this is build up my LinkedIn. I already have a few connections, but I learned that being active 
                        on the site, posting once a day, will turn the algorithm more in your favor.
                        <br/>
                        This can bode very well, as employers browse LinkedIn all the time to recruit people via the hidden job market.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I am an introvert with autism, so networking events aren't really my thing, but I may decide to go to a few of those as well. For now, 
                        however, this is definitely my best bet to start reaching my goals.
